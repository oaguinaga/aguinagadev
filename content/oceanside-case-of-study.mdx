## Not much money but skills and time

I was in Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca — surfing, eating tacos, and secretly plotting to buy land — when I met Sergio, a local real estate developer with a drool-worthy portfolio and zero online presence. His marketing plan? Word-of-mouth and flyers. In 2024.

A few cervezas later, we had a deal: I’d build him an MVP in four weeks, and he’d give me a “good price” on some land. Cue a solo coding marathon powered by ocean breezes, mango smoothies, and just enough Wi-Fi to turn beachside daydreams into an investor-ready prototype.

## The Tech Stack


I had experience with **Nuxt 3** and **Tailwind CSS**, but I wanted to push my boundaries. Enter **DaisyUI**, **Better Auth**, **Drizzle ORM**, and **Turso** - technologies I'd been eyeing but never had the chance to use in production.

<OceansideTechStack />

### Why These Choices?

- **DaisyUI**: 40+ pre-built components that look professional out-of-the-box? Yes, please! Dark/light theme support without writing a single line of custom CSS? Even better!
- **Better Auth**: Authentication that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out? Sign me up! Google OAuth 2.0 implementation in under 2 hours? Now we're talking!
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with excellent TypeScript support? Check! Local-first development that makes debugging a breeze? Double check! As a primarily frontend developer, having a database layer that felt familiar and intuitive was a game-changer.
- **Turso**: A generous free plan that doesn't nickel-and-dime you? Yes! Edge-ready SQLite that scales globally? Even better! The fact that I could develop locally with a real database and then deploy to the edge without changing a single line of code was exactly what I needed for rapid iteration.

## The Development Sprint: Learning While Building

### Week 1: Foundation & Authentication
- Set up the Nuxt 3 project with TypeScript
- Integrated Better Auth with Google OAuth (surprisingly painless!)
- Built the basic database schema with Turso and Drizzle ORM
- Created the authentication flow

### Week 2: Core Features & UI
- Built 15+ reusable components using DaisyUI
- Implemented the location management system
- Created the dashboard interface
- Added image upload functionality with AWS S3

### Week 3: Maps & Polish
- Integrated MapLibre GL for interactive property mapping
- Built the synchronized highlighting system (my personal favorite!)
- Added responsive design and mobile optimization
- Polished the user experience

## The "Magic Moment": Synchronized Map Interactions

Here's what I'm most proud of: the seamless interaction between the sidebar, map pins, and location cards. When you hover over a location card, the corresponding map pin highlights, and vice versa. The sidebar automatically scrolls to show the selected location. It's like they're all connected by invisible strings - smooth, intuitive, and downright satisfying to use.

This wasn't just about making it look pretty; it was about creating a user experience that felt natural and responsive. MapLibre GL made this surprisingly straightforward, and the result was exactly what I envisioned.

## What I Learned: The Power of the Right Tools

### DaisyUI: Component Development on Steroids
- Built professional-looking UI components in record time
- Dark/light theme switching without breaking a sweat
- Responsive design that just works
- No more fighting with CSS frameworks

### Better Auth: Authentication That Actually Works
- OAuth implementation that didn't require a PhD in security
- Seamless integration with my existing stack
- Customizable without being overwhelming
- Documentation that actually helps

### Drizzle ORM: Database Operations That Feel Natural
- Type-safe queries that catch errors at compile time
- Local-first development with easy debugging
- Migrations that actually make sense
- Schema definitions that double as TypeScript types

### Turso: Database That Grows With You
- Generous free tier (no surprise charges!)
- Local development that mirrors production
- Edge-ready architecture from day one
- SQLite familiarity without the deployment headaches

### MapLibre GL: Maps Made Simple
- Intuitive API that doesn't fight you
- Great TypeScript support
- Smooth performance even with complex interactions
- Active community and excellent documentation

## Stepping Out of My Comfort Zone: Full-Stack Development

As a primarily frontend developer, this project was an exciting opportunity to stretch my skills. Building a full-stack application forced me to think about data flow, API design, and system architecture in ways I hadn't before. 

The beauty of modern tools like Drizzle and Turso is that they make backend development feel approachable. I didn't need to become a database expert overnight - I just needed to understand how to structure my data and let the tools handle the complexity. This experience reinforced my belief that the best developers aren't specialists in one area, but generalists who can understand the full picture and choose the right tools for the job.

## The Business Reality: MVP vs. Production Dreams

The MVP was successful in demonstrating the concept to investors, but it revealed some real-world challenges Sergio hadn't considered:

- **Data Management**: They manage hundreds of individual lots, not just grouped locations
- **Content Creation**: Getting high-quality photos and descriptions for each property
- **Operational Capacity**: They don't have the bandwidth to maintain detailed property data

The app showed residential lots grouped by location, but ideally, it should display individual lots with their status (available, sold, under contract, etc.). This was a valuable lesson in understanding the difference between what's technically possible and what's operationally feasible.

## The Outcome: More Than Just Code

**Technical Achievement**: A fully functional MVP built in 3 weeks using modern web technologies  
**Business Impact**: Professional prototype that helped secure investor interest  
**Personal Growth**: Mastered new technologies while working on a real project  
**Skill Expansion**: Successfully ventured into full-stack development territory  
**Relationship Building**: Formed a lasting friendship with Sergio

## Key Takeaways for Future Projects

1. **Choose the Right Tools**: DaisyUI, Better Auth, Drizzle, and Turso saved me countless hours
2. **Learn While Building**: New technologies are easier to master with real-world applications
3. **Step Outside Your Comfort Zone**: Full-stack development is more approachable than ever
4. **Understand the Business**: Technical solutions must align with operational capabilities
5. **Build for Users**: Smooth interactions (like my map synchronization) make all the difference
6. **Embrace Constraints**: 3-week timeline forced me to focus on what mattered most
7. **Local-First Development**: Being able to develop and test locally accelerates iteration cycles

## The Tech Stack in Action

- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3, Vue 3 Composition API, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, responsive design
- **Backend**: Turso (SQLite), Drizzle ORM, AWS S3
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Google OAuth 2.0
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL with custom interactions
- **State Management**: Pinia for reactive state
- **Validation**: Vee-Validate + Zod for robust forms
- **Development**: Local-first database with edge-ready deployment

## Performance & Developer Experience Highlights

- **Build Time**: Fast development cycles with Nuxt 3's hot reload
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript coverage from database to UI
- **Local Development**: Full-stack development environment that mirrors production
- **Component Reusability**: 15+ components built in record time with DaisyUI
- **Database Migrations**: Seamless schema evolution with Drizzle
- **Edge Deployment**: Global performance without complex infrastructure

## Final Thoughts

This project taught me that the best learning happens when you're solving real problems for real people. Sergio needed a website, I wanted to learn new technologies, and somehow we both got what we wanted in just 3 weeks.

The MVP might not have solved all of Sergio's business challenges, but it proved that with the right tools and approach, you can build something impressive quickly. Plus, I got to spend 3 weeks coding on the beach - not a bad way to level up your skills!

Sometimes the best projects come from unexpected opportunities, and sometimes the best deals aren't about the money - they're about the experience, the learning, and the friendships you build along the way. This project reinforced my belief that stepping outside your comfort zone is where the real growth happens, and that modern tools make full-stack development accessible to developers of all backgrounds.
