## Hi There! I'm Omar 🤙🏽

I lost my job in May 2025 — about three months ago from the time I’m writing this. I’d been freelancing as a developer at Ilume, working on an AI-powered smart feeding and activity-tracking app. I really enjoyed my time there: I made some wonderful friends, built cool things, and learned a ton. But after almost three years, the truth is… I was burned out.

When the contract ended, I was a mix of tired, disappointed, and just slightly overwhelmed by the mountain of work I knew was waiting if I wanted to get back in the job hunt. If you’ve been through developer recruitment, you know the drill: endless interviews, tricky technical challenges, and the need to keep up with tech that evolves faster than a Tamagotchi left unattended. On top of that, my personal website had been gathering digital dust, and I decided it was time to give it a full makeover.

And because I like making life interesting, I figured I’d also spin all that effort into a shiny new personal project — something that could show recruiters what my coding style looks like in action.

The project I landed on was **Pianopal** — a beginner-friendly app that helps people *learn, visualize, and practice* piano scales and chords with color, sound, and joy. By the time I’m writing this, the MVP is already live at ~[pianopal.io](https://pianopal.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)~, and honestly, I couldn’t be prouder. The result turned out even better than I imagined, and the process reminded me of something I’d been missing: the joy (and rush) of taking an idea from nothing to a real, working app out in the world.

Building Pianopal gave me the chance to dive deeper into full-stack development and experiment with new tools. More importantly, it pushed me out of my comfort zone. I tried not to think only like a developer, but also like a designer, a teacher, and even a student: *how do you make music theory feel less like homework and more like play?*

Along the way, I honed my skills with **Nuxt, Tailwind, TypeScript, Node.js, and Drizzle**, and I loved every moment of building something full-stack that was polished, interactive, and meaningful. This little project reminded me why I fell in love with software in the first place: you start with nothing but an idea, and if you stick with it long enough, you end up with something that can bring joy (or at least fewer headaches) to real people.

I’m glad I decided to build Pianopal. What started as a small itch to scratch turned into so much more. Three months ago I was in over my head — now I feel like I’m hitting my stride. I’m more motivated than ever to keep building apps and riding this wave of excitement about tech. And that’s exactly why I’m starting this blog.

For years I put it off. I got stuck fiddling with setups, chasing the “perfect” first version, and eventually burning out at the thought of maintaining another empty corner of the internet. But that fear’s gone now.

Sure, maybe it’s the *worst* time to start a blog — AI is everywhere, and it feels like it’s eating the internet alive. But here’s the thing: I still stumble across random blogs that save me when I’m stuck, and I know at least one person (hi, future me) will benefit from me documenting this journey.

This blog will be my personal playground — a space to experiment, document what I’m learning, and share the projects I’m building along the way. I hope it becomes a living archive of ideas, lessons, and experiences that might even be helpful to others.

Now that Pianopal is out in the world and my site is nearly done, I’m officially on the lookout for my next adventure — either remotely or on-site in Seville, Spain. I’m especially excited about working on **consumer-facing web apps** where I can be part of the design and user experience process — places where I can keep growing while building products people actually enjoy using.

So if you’ve read this far and you’re building something exciting — hi 👋🏽 I’d love to hear from you.
