## Hi There! I'm Omar

I’ve always wanted a space to share my thoughts and projects — and this blog is exactly that. While AI and social media dominate online spaces today, I still believe in the value of personal blogs. This will be my playground to experiment with new ideas, document my learnings, and showcase the projects I’m working on. Over time, I hope it grows into a living archive of my work and experiences.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you enjoy your stay.


## About Me

I’m a software engineer from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, currently looking for new opportunities — either remote or on-site in Seville, Spain.

I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can simplify complex problems and create meaningful experiences. My focus is on building web applications that are fast, scalable, and user-friendly. As a frontend developer, I’m especially passionate about crafting interfaces that feel intuitive, engaging, and genuinely helpful for end users.

Over the years, I’ve worked with a range of technologies, including **React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript**. I’m also proficient in **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, which allows me to contribute across the full stack when needed.

Right now, I’m building [PianoPal](https://pianopal.io), a web app designed to help people learn piano in a more interactive and enjoyable way.


## What to Expect Here

On this blog, I’ll be sharing posts about web development, frontend best practices, and my personal projects. I also plan to write about my journey moving to Spain and looking for new opportunities in the tech world.
