## Hi There! I'm Omar 🤙🏽

I lost my job in May 2025 — about three months ago from when I’m writing this. I was freelancing at Ilume, working on an AI-powered smart feeding and activity-tracking app. I really enjoyed my time there: I made great friends, built cool things, and learned a ton. But after almost three years, the truth is… I was burned out.

When the contract ended, I felt tired, disappointed, and slightly overwhelmed at the thought of diving back into developer recruitment: endless interviews, tricky technical challenges, and keeping up with tech that evolves faster than a Tamagotchi left unattended. On top of that, my personal website had been gathering digital dust, so I decided it was time for a full makeover.

To make life interesting, I spun that effort into a personal project that could showcase my coding style: Pianopal — a beginner-friendly app that helps people learn, visualize, and practice piano scales and chords with color, sound, and joy. By the time I’m writing this, the MVP is live at pianopal.io
. The result turned out even better than I imagined, and the process reminded me of something I’d been missing: the thrill of taking an idea from nothing to a real, working app.

Building Pianopal pushed me out of my comfort zone. I tried not to think only like a developer, but also like a designer, a teacher, and even a student: how do you make music theory feel less like homework and more like play? Along the way, I honed my skills with Nuxt, Tailwind, TypeScript, Node.js, and Drizzle, and loved every moment of creating something full-stack that was polished, interactive, and meaningful.

Three months ago, I was in over my head — now I feel like I’m hitting my stride. I’m more motivated than ever to keep building apps and riding this wave of excitement about tech. That’s exactly why I’m starting this blog.

For years I put it off. I got stuck fiddling with setups, chasing the “perfect” first version, and burned out at the thought of maintaining another empty corner of the internet. But that fear’s gone now. Sure, maybe it’s the worst time to start a blog — AI is everywhere, and it feels like it’s eating the internet alive. But I still stumble across random blogs that save me when I’m stuck, and I know at least one person (hi, future me) will benefit from documenting this journey.

This blog will be my personal playground — a space to experiment, document what I’m learning, and share projects along the way. I hope it becomes a living archive of ideas, lessons, and experiences that might help others too.

Now that Pianopal is out in the world and my site is nearly done, I’m officially on the lookout for my next adventure — remote or on-site in Seville, Spain. I’m especially excited about working on consumer-facing web apps where I can be part of the design and user experience process, in a team that values learning, growth, and a good vibe.

So if you’ve read this far and you’re building something exciting — hi 👋🏽 I’d love to hear from you.
